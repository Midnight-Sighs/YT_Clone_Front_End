## Design Choices
We wanted to use a neutral color pallete because there's no way to know what colors any given video will be in order to style with.  Because the comments and replies are anonymous, we chose to display them all back to back - there's no need for any identifiers and it allows you to follow a whole conversation (if there is one) without anything impeding your view of it.
