## Design Choices
We wanted to use a neutral color pallete because there's no way to know what colors any given video will be in order to style with.  Because the comments and replies are anonymous, we chose to display them all back to back - there's no need for any identifiers and it allows you to follow a whole conversation (if there is one) without anything impeding your view of it.  This layout and design has the potential to be more centered on chat than YouTube itself, as the chat is front and center and requires no scrolling to search for.  You can see your video and access your comments without having to scroll if you aren't in full screen.
